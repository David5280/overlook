# Overwatch

Overwatch is my final solo project in module two at the Turing School of Software and Design.  It is a hotel management application designed to keep track of bookings, room service orders, past and present patrons, and rooms.  This application works with four seperate datasets retrieved from a third party using fetch, and uses classes, array prototype methods, jquery, SCSS, and good old plain JavaScript.

One week was allowed for the completion of **Overwatch**.

## Installation

 - clone the repo to your local machine
 - run npm install to download all necessay dependencies
 - run npm start to run the server
 - open localhost:8080 (unless your terminal says otherwise)
 - experiment with the different functionalities.
 
 ## Learning Goals
 - Object Oriented Programming
 - Test Driven Development
 - SASS/SCSS
 - Fetch API for receiving 3rd party data
 - Webpack

 This project helped to solidify concepts, techniques, and principles learned over the past twelve weeks.
